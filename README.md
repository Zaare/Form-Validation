## Description
This project validates a form with the following fields:

Each field is validated using a regular expression to ensure that the user has entered a valid value.

## Features
- Validates the Name field to make sure it is not empty
- Validates the Phone field to make sure it is a valid 11-digit phone number

- Validates the Password field to make sure it meets certain criteria:
    - At least 8 characters long
    - Contains at least one uppercase letter

If any of the fields are not valid, an error message is displayed. Once all fields are valid, the form can be submitted.
